    "text": "Environment Setup and Package Installation\nEnvironment Setup\nPlease ensure that R version 3.6 or higher is installed on your computer. This is required to install the falcon package and its dependencies. You can check your current version of R by running sessionInfo() within the R console.\nInstalling Package Dependencies\nThe falcon package requires several packages available from the Insights Engineering organization on GitHub.\nTo use the falcon package, ensure you have these necessary package dependencies installed by running the following code:\n\nif (!require(\"formatters\")) install.packages(\"formatters\")\nif (!require(\"rtables\")) install.packages(\"rtables\")\nif (!require(\"rlistings\")) install.packages(\"rlistings\")\nif (!require(\"remotes\")) install.packages(\"remotes\")\nif (!require(\"tern\")) remotes::install_github(\"insightsengineering/tern@*release\")\n\nOptionally, to run the examples provided within the falcon package and on this site you can also install the synthetic CDISC data packages, which contain the example datasets, by running the following:\n\nif (!require(\"scda\")) remotes::install_github(\"insightsengineering/scda@*release\")\nif (!require(\"scda.2022\")) remotes::install_github(\"insightsengineering/scda.2022@*release\")\n\nFor more information on these packages, see the Additional Resources section below.\nInstalling the falcon Package\nTo install the falcon package, run the following line of code:\n\nif (!require(\"falcon\")) remotes::install_github(\"pharmaverse/falcon\")\n\nLoading Data\nThe table functions provided by falcon are designed to work with any datasets which adhere to CDISC standards. If you have access to CDISC data, load this into your R environment as usual to use when generating tables.\nIf you do not have access to CDISC data, or want to run the examples provided within the package, you can use the scda package to load a selection of datasets stored in the scda.2022 package containing example synthetic CDISC data. Datasets can be loaded using the synthetic_cdisc_dataset() function from scda. Specify the archive_name parameter, setting archive_name as \"latest\" for the most recent version, or setting another version if desired (see the list of all available versions by running scda::ls_synthetic_cdisc_data()). The dataset_name parameter must also be specified with the name of the desired dataset in lowercase, e.g. dataset_name = \"adsl\". This data is loaded in where necessary as part of the provided examples.\nTemplate Navigation\nA list of all templates currently available in falcon is provided in the Template Library Index, with tables designed based on the FDA Standard Safety Tables and Figures: Integrated Guide.\nEach template provided is associated with a function available within the falcon package, and contains 4 sections:\n\n\nSpec. Screenshot: This tab provides a screenshot of the given table coming from the FDA Standard Safety Table and Figures document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable: This tab displays the output table corresponding to the screenshot in the previous tab, generated using the associated falcon table function. You can expect a similar output table when using the table function with your own data, depending on pre-processing and the customizations that you apply via the table function parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Setup: This tab provides the code used to generate the example table displayed in the previous tab, including the loading of necessary libraries and example datasets, and any pre-processing steps applied prior to generating the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction Details: This tab includes details on the table-generating function used for this template. Table functions use the naming convention make_table_XX() where XX is the table number taken from the FDA Standard Safety Table and Figures document (preceded by a 0 if the number is a single digit). Any required variables for the input datasets are listed along with a description of all function arguments. This information is mirrored by the function’s help page accesible within R (i.e. ?make_table_XX).\n\n\n\n\n\n          A link to the function’s source code can be found at the bottom of the page in this tab:\n\n\n\n\nCreating Tables\nThere are many table-generating functions available within the falcon package, each of which is used to generate a different FDA standard safety table using R. These functions create rtables table objects which can then be further customized, paginated, etc. if required using functions from the rtables package.\nUsing the Table Functions\nTo use the table functions you will need to load the falcon package and then call the appropriate table function. For example, to create FDA Safety Table 2, you can run the following code:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(falcon)\n\n# Data pre-processing - ensure all necessary variables are present in the data\nadsl &lt;- scda::synthetic_cdisc_dataset(\"latest\", \"adsl\") %&gt;%\n  dplyr::mutate(AGEGR1 = as.factor(dplyr::case_when(\n    AGE &gt;= 17 & AGE &lt;

You can customize tables by specifying function parameter values to set input data, variables to include in the table, table annotations, etc.\nTable Customization\nEach template takes several arguments that can be set to generate a table that meets your requirements. A brief overview of the parameters for each template is provided in the Function Details section of each table template page (see the Function Details section above) and the function’s help page within R (i.e. ?make_table_XX), with many of these parameters being standard across table functions.\nTo customize the output table, you can modify the values of these arguments as per your requirements.

Developers are connected via Slack and GitHub for the creation of shared solutions using publicly available analysis packages for R. Developers are invited to browse the falcon project repository and related packages for insight into our template designs.\n\nJoining as a Collaborator\nAs always we invite further collaboration and welcome additional companies to join the falcon initiative and contribute to the project. Please feel free to contact any of the repository maintainers for more information and check out the section below for more information on joining the project as a developer.\n\nInformation for Developers\nAs a pharmaverse collaboration, we invite any interested developers to join the falcon team and contribute to template development. To onboard as a developer, please reach out to one of the falcon Product Owners (Vincent Shen, Freeman Wang, Juergen Boehl, Lian Lin, or Clara Beck) to receive access to the falcon GitHub repository.\nTasks are assigned and prioritized via issues on our GitHub project board and worked on in development branches. Members of the team will review each other’s code and make suggestions before new functions and features are incorporated into the package.\nWe encourage the smart developer to familiarize themselves with the following packages as they contain functions leveraged by falcon for table creation:\n\nrtables: Table creation\ntern: Clinical trials analysis functions\nscda.2022: Example synthetic CDISC datasets\nscda: Loading synthetic CDISC data"

    "text": "Implementation of FDA Safety Tables and Figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is falcon?\nThe falcon initiative is an industry collaborative effort under pharmaverse that brings together pharmaceutical companies with the aspiration of building and open-sourcing a catalog of harmonized tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs) in clinical study reporting. Leveraging existing open-source R packages, falcon aims to simplify the process of output review, comparison and meta-analyses, foster efficient communication among stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector, while aligning with CDISC’s ARD/ARM effort at the same time. Drawing inspiration from the FDA Standard Safety Tables and Figures Integrated Guide, templates are developed and goinig to be open-sourced. Future plans entail expanding the catalog through continuous collaboration from participating companies and inviting wider industry to promote harmonization of TLGs for clinical reporting.\n\nGetting Started\nTemplate Library Index \n \n\n\nOur Collaboration Journey\nFAQ\n\nUpcoming\n\n…\nContributors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoche\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoehringer Ingelheim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanofi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerna"
