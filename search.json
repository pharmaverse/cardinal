    "text": "Implementation of FDA Safety Tables and Figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is falcon?\nThe falcon initiative is an industry collaborative effort under pharmaverse that brings together pharmaceutical companies with the aspiration of building and open-sourcing a catalog of harmonized tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs) in clinical study reporting. Leveraging existing open-source R packages, falcon aims to simplify the process of output review, comparison and meta-analyses, foster efficient communication among stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector, while aligning with CDISC’s ARD/ARM effort at the same time. Drawing inspiration from the FDA Standard Safety Tables and Figures Integrated Guide, templates are developed and goinig to be open-sourced. Future plans entail expanding the catalog through continuous collaboration from participating companies and inviting wider industry to promote harmonization of TLGs for clinical reporting.\n\nGetting Started\nTemplate Library Index \n \n\n\nOur Journey\nFAQ\n\nUpcoming\n\n…\nContributors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoche\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoehringer Ingelheim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanofi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerna"
