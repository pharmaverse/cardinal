#### What is it about?

The {falcon} initiative is an industry collaborative effort under {pharmaverse} that brings together pharmaceutical companies with the aspiration of building and open-sourcing a catalog of harmonized tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs) in clinical study reporting. Leveraging existing open-source R packages, {falcon} aims to simplify the process of output review, comparison and meta-analyses, foster efficient communication among stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector, while aligning with CDISC's ARD/ARM effort at the same time. Drawing inspiration from the FDA Standard Safety Tables and Figures Integrated Guide, templates are developed and goinig to be open-sourced. Future plans entail expanding the catalog through continuous collaboration from participating companies and inviting wider industry to promote harmonization of TLGs for clinical reporting.
