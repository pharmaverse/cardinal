#### What is cardinal?

The cardinal initiative (formerly "falcon") is an industry collaborative effort under pharmaverse that brings together pharmaceutical companies with the aspiration of building and open-sourcing a catalog of harmonized tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs) in clinical study reporting. Leveraging existing open-source R packages, cardinal aims to simplify the process of output review, comparison, and meta-analyses, fostering efficient communication among stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector while aligning with CDISC's ARD/ARM effort at the same time. Drawing inspiration from the FDA Standard Safety Tables and Figures Integrated Guide, we develop open-source templates. Future plans entail expanding the catalog of templates through continuous collaboration from participating companies and inviting wider industry to promote harmonization of TLGs for clinical reporting.
