#### What is cardinal?

The cardinal initiative (formerly "falcon") is an industry collaborative effort under pharmaverse that brings together pharmaceutical companies with the aspiration of building and open-sourcing a catalog of harmonized tables, listings, and graphs (TLGs) in clinical study reporting. Leveraging existing open-source R packages, cardinal aims to simplify the process of output review, comparison, and meta-analyses, fostering efficient communication among stakeholders in the pharmaceutical sector while aligning with CDISC's ARD/ARM effort at the same time. Drawing initial inspiration from the FDA Standard Safety Tables and Figures Integrated Guide, we develop open-source templates from this guide as well as additional sources. Future plans entail expanding the catalog of templates through continuous collaboration from participating companies and inviting wider industry to promote harmonization of TLGs for clinical reporting.
