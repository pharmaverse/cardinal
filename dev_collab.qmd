As a pharmaverse collaboration, we invite any interested developers to join the falcon team and contribute to template development. To on-board as a developer, please reach out to a product owner (Vincent Shen, Freeman Wang, Lian Lin or Thomas Neitman) to receive access to the falcon GitHub repository.

Priorities are assigned as issues on our project board and worked on in development branches. Members of the team will review code or make suggestions before incorporating templates in the package.

We encourage the smart developer to familiarize themselves with the following packages:

[`rtables`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rtables) - for table layout creation

[`tern`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/tern) - for rtables wrapper functions

[`scda`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/scda) - for test data

As they contain functions leveraged by falcon for table creation.
