#### 1. \ How can I join this initiative?

For information on how to join the cardinal initiative please see the [Joining as a Collaborator](https://pharmaverse.github.io/cardinal/quarto/about.html#joining-as-a-collaborator) section of the About page.
<br/><br/>


#### 2. \ I copied the example code for one of the cardinal TLGs. How can I customize the TLG?

Every template in the catalog generates a `gtsummary` object (or `ggplot2` object for graphs) which can be customized using the standard modification functions available in the {gtsummary} (or {ggplot2} for graphs) package. Please see this package for more information on customization and formatting options.
<br/><br/>


#### 3. \ I need a TLG that isn't available on the cardinal website. Can I request a table be added?

The cardinal team is actively maintaining and adding new TLG templates to the project catalog. If you would like to see a TLG that is not listed on the cardinal website, please file a New TLG Template issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pharmaverse/cardinal/issues/new/choose) and the team will work on adding it to the catalog. Please also consider adding the template to the catalog yourself! We are always happy to have new contributors join the initiative (even if you can only add a single TLG!) - for information on how to add a new template yourself see the [Getting Started](getting_started.qmd) page.
<br/><br/>


#### 4. \ I don't know the ID of the table I am interested in. Is there a list of TLGs by description?

A list of all available TLGs by both description and ID/source is available on the [Template Catalog](index-catalog.qmd) page, and can be sorted/filtered accordingly. The category tags on the right-hand side of the page can be used to filter for specific TLGs.
